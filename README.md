# Job Portal
A full-stack job portal web application developed as part of the internship at ICT Academy of Kerala, in collaboration with AWH Engineering College. This platform, built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, enables job seekers to easily search and apply for job listings, while administrators have control over job postings and application tracking. The portal aims to provide a streamlined, user-friendly experience for all users.

Project Overview
The job portal was developed to connect job seekers with employers, simplifying the recruitment process for both parties. This internship project showcases full-stack development skills by utilizing the MERN stack to create a scalable, secure, and high-performance platform.
